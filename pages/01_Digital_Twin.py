## Knowledge Graph Representation of Entities

The Digital Twin Layer is the foundation of the Context-AI platform, creating a comprehensive 
knowledge graph representation of each entity that captures not just attributes, but all 
relevant relationships and context.

    In Context-AI, a Digital Twin is a knowledge graph that represents an entity (like a 
    loan application) with all its attributes, relationships, and connections to relevant 
    context. This goes beyond traditional database records by modeling the entity within its 
    complete network of relationships.

### Key Insights from the Knowledge Graph

The power of the digital twin representation comes from the ability to see connections that 
would be invisible in traditional data models:

- **Industry-Specific Context**: Understanding how this company performs relative to industry benchmarks
- **Financial Health Relationships**: Seeing how different financial metrics relate to each other
- **Ownership Structure Impact**: Recognizing how management experience connects to business performance
- **Loan Purpose Alignment**: Evaluating how the loan purpose aligns with business financials

st.markdown("""
The Digital Twin Layer serves as the foundation for the entire Context-AI platform:

1. It provides the base representation that the **Temporal Intelligence Layer** tracks over time
2. It connects to external context through the **External Integration Layer**
3. It supplies the comprehensive view that the **Adaptive Guidance Layer** analyzes for recommendations

By starting with a rich, relationship-first representation, we enable all the other capabilities 
of the platform.
